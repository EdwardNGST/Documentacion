Add an image in a WPF button
In the case of a 'missing' image there are several things to consider:

When XAML can't locate a resource it might ignore it (when it won't throw a XamlParseException)

The resource must be properly added and defined:

Make sure it exists in your project where expected.

Make sure it is built with your project as a resource.

(Right click → Properties → BuildAction='Resource')

Snippet

Another thing to try in similar cases, which is also useful for reusing of the image (or any other resource):

Define your image as a resource in your XAML:

<UserControl.Resources>
     <Image x:Key="MyImage" Source.../>
</UserControl.Resources>
And later use it in your desired control(s):

<Button Content="{StaticResource MyImage}" />
